# Execution

This directory contains deterministic Python scripts. These serve as the "Layer 3" of the architecture: the tools that do the work.

## Principals
- **Deterministic**: Scripts should be reliable and repeatable.
- **Focused**: Each script should do one thing well.
- ** Documented**: Include comments and docstrings.

## Structure
- Scripts should be runnable from the root directory.
- Use `argparse` for command-line arguments.
